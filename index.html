            1. Cost effective Multi-Platform Development
            <br>
            A single line of code can be used on multiple platforms and devices, and this is an advantage because it reduces the development and maintenance costs over the website or web app’s lifetime. The recent best practice for cross-platform such as Android and IOS application development is a “Hybrid”, wherein web standards are supported within a native app “wrapper that can be easily placed in the Android or iOS store.

            2. Offline browsing
            <br>
            Applications can be used offline, without the need of an internet connection. Similarly, the HTML5 supports local storage of web application code and content via the offline application cache. It is one of the great advantages to businesses such as publishers, who can offer an offline web experience for their potential readers. In fact, an offline cache also generates excellent performance improvisations.

In fact, the inclusion of direct video content on a web page can also boost the ranking of the website in search engine results. It is because videos quickly appeal to the visitors and quality content always increases the ranking of a site.
